</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Mr. President,</span></p>
<p class='c007'>I purpose to devote the time, which your indulgence
has placed at my disposal this evening, to laying before
you the results of some inquiries into the origin and
history of medicine and of the medical profession;
regarding the subject rather from a <i>social</i> than from
a <i>scientific</i> point of view.</p>

<p class='c008'>My scheme will introduce you to some of your old
acquaintances; not for instruction, but to remind you
of those passages in their lives which may have been
pressed out of your memories by the sterner realities of
professional duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>An inquiry into the origin of medicine must begin
with the history of man himself, since pain and death
are the inevitable conditions of his existence; and the
desire to mitigate the former, and postpone the triumphs
of the latter arose from, and has kept pace with, the
development of the various diseases to which time and
circumstances have subjected him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>primal man</i>, we know, was created pure and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>innocent, free from liability to pain, and possessed of
unmixed capacity for the enjoyment of the pleasures
that surrounded him; glowing with health, and with
every emotion redolent of new delight. At sight of him,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Each hill gave sign of gratulation,</div>
      <div class='line'>Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs</div>
      <div class='line'>Whisper’d it to the woods; and from their wings</div>
      <div class='line'>Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy <span class="nowrap">shrub:—</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Apprehension of the miseries to which his progeny were
doomed, would have marred this happiness; hence his
ignorance of evil, and his belief that the felicity he
enjoyed would be as permanent as it was perfect. But
our business is with man in his <i>actual</i> condition; the
sport of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“All maladies</div>
      <div class='line'>Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms</div>
      <div class='line'>Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Intestine stone, and ulcer, colic pangs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Demoniac phrensy, moping melancholy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Marasmus and wide wasting pestilence,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dropsies and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums,</div>
      <div class='line'>And over them triumphant Death his dart</div>
      <div class='line'>Shook, but delayed to strike.”——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Undertaking to examine the subject <i>ab initio</i>, we must
take into account the sources of our information, and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>our knowledge of every event <i>antecedent to the discovery
of writing</i> must have been transmitted by oral or traditional
agencies, we have to settle, in some degree, how
far such evidence is worthy of credence.</p>

<p class='c008'>According to popular belief, the Noahic flood destroyed
the whole human race, with the exception of Noah and
his family; who were therefore the sole depositories of
the traditions of the events which had occurred between
the time of Adam and themselves. The great longevity
of these antediluvian fathers made this oral transmission
easy; and we know, that the sons of Noah lived to
see the birth of Abraham, whom, as the founder of
circumcision, we claim as the first operative surgeon on
record.</p>

<p class='c008'>In dealing with dates, I adopt the commonly accepted
chronology, unmoved by those refined speculations so
much in favour at this time.</p>

<p class='c008'>I begin with Moses, for whatever evidence may be
urged upon us in the shape of marbles, or monuments,
claiming an antiquity anterior to the advent of the
Jewish <a id='corr5.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='original: law-giver'>lawgiver</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_5.24'>lawgiver</a></span>, it is a positive and unimpeachable
fact, that no <i>writings</i> are in existence, which in point of
age reach within many centuries of the Pentateuch;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>indeed, as we shall presently see, the oldest of the
Greek writers are, in comparison with Moses, but as
the children of yesterday.</p>

<p class='c008'>The five books of Moses were written 1500 years
before Christ. Hesiod, the father of Greek literature,
flourished 500 years later; and Homer, the next in
succession, nearly a century after Hesiod.</p>

<p class='c008'>Herodotus places Homer 400 years before himself;
thus bringing the “father of history,” as he is termed
by Cicero, to about 500 years before the advent of our
Saviour, so that the difference of date between the author
of the Pentateuch and the oldest Greek historian cannot
be much less than 1000 years.</p>

<p class='c008'>I pass over the pretended antiquity of the Chinese
and Parsis records: these have been disposed of very
satisfactorily, and however much <i>fancy</i> may dwell upon
the losses to literature inflicted by the Caliph Omar,
when he destroyed the Alexandrian library,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> in the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>640, a very little reflection will convince us that as these
treasures, real or assumed, had been ransacked for ages,
by the brightest spirits of Greece and Rome, everything
worthy of note has been handed down to us.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>learned</i> talk about the writings of the Assyrians,
the Babylonians, and the Egyptians; but they do not
produce a single scrap of tangible evidence in support
of these pretensions.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may, however, be contended, that although there
are no <i>writings</i> extant, <i>traditional</i> evidence is very
strong; and this establishes a high antiquity for Lycurgus,
who lived 900 years before the Christian era.
The more, therefore, we inquire, the stronger the proof
becomes, that Moses as a lawgiver flourished 600 years
before the highest claimant to our veneration on the
grounds of primitiveness; and thus we are entitled to
assume that the Greek legislator took much that is
excellent, in the laws ascribed to him, from his Jewish
predecessor.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Lycurgus lived about the time that Shishak, king of
Egypt, destroyed the temple of Solomon, and carried
away many captives: it is therefore no very extravagant
supposition, that the Pentateuch of Moses was known
to the great lawgiver. During the peaceful reign of
king Solomon, the intercourse between the Jews and
the Egyptians was frequent and extensive, for the great
monarch, needing the assistance of skilful artificers for
the construction of the Temple at Jerusalem, broke
down that barrier of exclusiveness that had previously
isolated his people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the <i>learned</i> of that day were seekers after
wisdom wherever it was to be found; and moreover, as
the fame of Solomon was co-extensive with the then
existing world, so acute an observer as the <i>founder</i> of
the Grecian law could not fail to use the materials
which the wide spread knowledge of the Jewish kings
sayings and doings had placed within his reach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every Jew was required to read the law, or hear it
read, once a year—each individual therefore became a
living depository of its truths, and, consequently, a
somewhat competent teacher of those who might desire
to be instructed in such matters.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Moses</i> then comes before us as the first <i>writer</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the first <i>lawgiver</i>; and we shall now proceed to show
that to these titles he added the still greater distinction
of being the first <i>physician</i>, and promulgator of sanitary
precautions.</p>

<p class='c008'>At present, however, I will not further intrude upon
your patience, but leaving his claims where I have
placed them, pass on to the consideration of the character
of the laws themselves;—and here we arrive at a
body of enactments so excellent, so well adapted, not
only to the requirements of a nomadic people wandering
in a wild country, but to that <i>same</i> people when they
subsequently became dwellers in cities, and suffered all
the encumbrances of a more advanced civilization.
<i>Moses</i> made laws for <i>all</i> times and for <i>all</i> communities,
<i>general</i> as well as <i>particular</i>, reaching the <i>nation</i> through
every individual member thereof; his rules for the
preservation of health embraced the consideration of
personal cleanliness enforced as a <i>religious</i> obligation
in order that he might thereby enlist the unvarying
co-operation of the priesthood.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a climate incentive to animal enjoyments he placed
strict barriers for the preservation of <i>chastity</i>, and
decreed that matters relating to sexual intercourse
should be under the surveillance of the priest; directions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>were also given to the <i>menstruous</i> woman, and for her
conduct during <i>pregnancy</i> and in <i>childbed</i>. The ordinance
of circumcision was devised not alone for ablutionary
purposes, but for <i>other well understood</i> objects
conducive to purity. Further, it was directed how the
man should order himself in affections of the virile
organs; and more emphatically, what he was bound to
observe when the terrible <i>leprosy</i> afflicted him. In such
a calamity he was compelled to withdraw from his
house, to be separated from society, and present himself
to the priest at various periods during the progress of
the disease; he was also to remain in a cheerless exclusion,
where, if by chance any unwary passenger came
in sight, the sufferer was commanded to cry aloud,
<i>unclean! unclean!</i> When convalescence and health
returned, the <i>priest</i> pronounced him cured of his leprosy,
and he was then permitted to return to his home; but
if the leprosy was supposed to cling to the <i>habitation</i>,
<i>that</i>, too, was subjected to isolation, and in some
instances to total destruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>same precautions</i> obtain in our own times,
although nearly 3400 years have elapsed since they
were first insisted upon by Moses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, we are told by Dr. Thompson, an eminent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>American writer on the Holy Land (where he resided
many years), that lepers are everywhere regarded as
unclean, and that at Jerusalem (where there is always
a considerable number of them) a separate quarter in
the city is assigned to them, to which they are rigidly
confined. Dr. Thompson says: “I have seen them cast
out of the villages where they resided, and no healthy
person would touch them, eat with them, or use any of
their clothes or utensils, and even the Arab tent
dwellers cast them out of camp. The leper beggars
stand apart, and never attempt to touch you, even as it
was in the time of the Saviour, when the ten lepers
stood afar off and lifted up their voice of entreaty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The same writer furnishes us with the following
graphic description, which, as coming from an eye
witness, we have deemed worthy of <span class="nowrap">notice:—</span></p>

<p class='c008'>“Sauntering down the Jaffa road, on my way to the
Holy City, I was startled by the sudden apparition of a
crowd of beggars, sans eyes, sans nose, sans hair, sans
everything; they held up their handless arms, unearthly
sounds gurgled through throats without palates, and, in
a word, I stood horrified, when, for the first time, I
found myself face to face with a leper.” He then goes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>on to say: “For many years I have sought to get at
the mystery of its origin, but neither books nor learned
physicians have thrown any light upon it. I have
suspected that this remorseless enemy originates in
some self-propagating animalcules, and thus I can
conceive the possibility of the contagion reaching the
walls of a dwelling. No one has spoken with authority,
as to what it proceeds from or how it is generated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“New born babes of leprous parents are often as
pretty and healthy in appearance as other children,
but the ‘<i>scab</i>’ comes on by degrees, the hair falls off,
joint after joint of the fingers and toes shrink up, the
gums are absorbed, and the teeth fall out and disappear;
the nose, the eyes, the palate are slowly consumed,
and finally the wretched victim sinks into the
earth under a disease beyond the control of medicine,
which cannot even mitigate its tortures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To my mind there is no conceivable manifestation
of Divine power more triumphantly confirmatory of
Christ’s divinity than the cleansing of a leper with a
word.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The initiatory rite of circumcision was, by Divine
command, first performed by Abraham in the year of
the world 2107, or about 1897 years before <span class="nowrap">Christ:—</span>At
the age of 99 years, Abraham, together with his
son Ishmael and all his dependents were circumcised.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ishmael at this time was thirteen years old, and, as
we are informed by Josephus, was the founder of the
Arabian nation, who to this day do not circumcise until
after the thirteenth year.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Isaac, the child of promise, the heir who was to
carry on the race of the patriarch, was circumcised
on the eighth day after his birth, and this, among the
Hebrews, became a law, and a statute for ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the tapestries at Hampton Court, in the time
of Holbein, represents the operation being performed
upon Isaac, with what appears to be a knife made of
stone, which was the instrument used for many ages
for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the kindness of my friend, the Rev. William
Sparrow Simpson, the learned Librarian and Minor
Canon of St. Paul’s Cathedral, I am enabled to show
you some of these knives of stone; and further evidence
of the employment of such implements will be
found in Exodus 4th chapter and 25th verse, where
it is written—“Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and
cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his (Moses)
feet.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Some writers believe that the practice of circumcision
existed for ages amongst the Heathens before the time
of Abraham, whilst others have not hesitated to date
its origin as far back as our first fathers, asserting
that Adam was taught by the angel Gabriel to satisfy
an oath he had made to cut off that flesh, which after
his fall had rebelled against his spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much has been written with regard to the comparative
<i>antiquity</i> of this custom among the Egyptians and
Ethiopians; a point upon which the erudite Herodotus
leaves us in doubt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Circumcision of <i>both</i> sexes exists amongst the Abyssinians,
Nubians, Egyptians (both ancient and modern),
Hottentots, and probably many other nations. But in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Turkey, Persia, and in the South Sea Islands, and those
of the Indian Seas, the practice is confined to the <i>male</i>
sex. The Mohammedans adopt the rite of circumcision,
and Mahomet himself was circumcised, although
no mention is made of the fact in the Koran.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doubtless, the so-called circumcision of women, as it
is practised in some countries, is a modification of what
<i>we</i> understand by the term, and involves structures other
than the clitoris or nymphæ; and it is equally true
that the custom is adopted by many races totally irrespective
of any religious significance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sonnini de Manoncourt, a distinguished traveller and
naturalist of the eighteenth century “having examined
a young girl of Egyptian origin, about eight years old,
found a thick, flabby, and fleshy excrescence, covered
with skin, which grew above the commissure of the
labia, and hung down half an inch, resembling in size
and shape the caruncle pendent from the bill of a
turkey cock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Conditions of a similar nature are said to exist among
the women of the interior of Africa, and are probably
due to climatic influences, but the more common forms
of disease are those of simple hypertrophy of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>external parts of generation; and it is not unreasonable to
suppose that the surgical interference necessary for
their removal has given rise to the general term of
circumcision.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simple <i>excision</i> of the <i>clitoris</i> has been practised for
very many centuries by certain nations,” and I purpose
quoting some interesting observations just published by
Dr. T. H. Tanner, upon the subject. His first extract
is from Strabo, the geographer, <span class="nowrap"><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 21,</span> who, in speaking
of the Egyptians, <span class="nowrap">says:—</span>“They <i>circumcise</i> the males
and <i>excise</i> the females, as is the custom also among the
Jews, who are of Egyptian extraction.” The custom
appears to have been continued down to a recent period,
and Mr. W. G. Brown,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> who resided for some time at
Darfour, North Africa, writing in 1779, thus alludes to
<span class="nowrap">it:—</span>“The excision of females is a peculiarity with which
the northern nations are less familiar; yet it would
appear that this usage is more evidently founded on physical
causes, and is more clearly a matter of convenience,
than the circumcision of males, as it seems not to have
been ordained by the precept of any inspired writer.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“This excision is termed in Arabic ‘<i>chafadh</i>.’ It consists
of cutting off the clitoris a little before the period
of puberty, or at about the age of <i>eight</i> or <i>nine</i> years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, the Nubian traveller<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> <i>Burckhardt</i> tells us—“The
daughters of the Arabs <i>Ababde</i>, and <i>Djaafere</i>,
who are of Arabian origin, and inhabit the western bank
of the Nile from Thebes, as high as the cataracts, and
generally those of all the people to the south of <i>Kenne</i>
and <i>Esne</i> (as far as Sennaar) undergo circumcision, or
rather <i>excision</i> (excisio-clitoridis,) at the age of from
<i>three</i> to <i>six</i> years: Girls thus treated are called
<i>mukhaeyt</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But perhaps the most trustworthy account of the circumcision
of females in Western Africa is that given by
the late Mr. W. F. Daniel, who was a distinguished
member of our own profession. He tells us that “The
excisive process in Western Africa is variously performed
in accordance with the usages of the different
districts where it is resorted to. The operation consists
either <span class="nowrap">of:—</span></p>

<p class='c008'>“1. Simple excision of the clitoris; 2. excision of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the nymphæ; 3. excision of both nymphæ and clitoris;
4. excision of a portion of the labia pudendi, with
either or all of the preceding structures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The history of the operation is involved in obscurity;
that it was secretly inculcated as one of those
gloomy rites which the female proselyte had to undergo,
as a preliminary measure, prior to her initiation into
those dread mythological creeds, which, in Egypt and
the adjoining countries were swathed in the folds of an
allegorical and almost impenetrable mysticism, is the
most likely inference.” <i>Eventually</i> the progressive
decay of the religious institutions, gradually led to its
promulgation and practice among the masses of the
people; for the <i>priests</i>, who, independent of their scientific
attainments, were also well versed in medicine,
might have advocated its use both in a moral and
hygienic point of view, as conducive to the welfare of
the female population.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have been led into this digression by reflecting over
the barbarous and unphilosophical meddling of certain
practitioners of our metropolis who are, in effect, degrading
our practice of surgery to the level of that of
the savages we have just described, without possessing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the same claim to our consideration on the score of
ignorance, barbarism, and superstition. The modern
antic yclept “<i>clitoridectomy</i>” (to which I refer), is, as
the “Lancet” says, “a proceeding which, if it be
<i>useless</i>, is a <i>lamentable mistake</i>, and if it be <i>unnecessary</i>,
<i>a cruel outrage</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next proposition we may fairly look for will be
to imitate still further the customs of these Western
Africans who, in certain tribes, whenever a girl shows
any very strong indication of sexual feeling (before she
is betrothed), at once proceed to produce an obliteration
of her vagina by the intense inflammatory action
set up by the forcible introduction of a mass of the
“capsicum fructescens,” or bird pepper—to my mind
not one shade more inhuman or barbarous than unsexing
a woman for ever, upon an assumption which
grossly libels our female population.</p>

<p class='c008'>The position taken by the early Christians in reference
to the practice of circumcision was decidedly antagonistic,
so far as any value, in a <i>religious</i> point of view,
should be ascribed to it; nevertheless, their apostles
and teachers permitted it to continue, at the discretion
or inclination of those who chose to submit to it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>It is an interesting fact to note that the Copts, whose
Christianity dates back from the persecution of Diocletian
(called the era of martyrs) in 303, and the
Abyssinian Christians, who also reckon from the fourth
century, adopt the custom to this day, from a belief
that it gives them a further chance of entering Paradise,
beyond the baptism they receive as Christians. It
is also singular that these sects accept several other
doctrines and precepts of the Mohammedans and Jews,
among whom they dwell.</p>

<p class='c008'>The precise mode of operating upon males varies in
different countries. In Madagascar three separate and
distinct operations are inflicted upon the individual.
In the South Sea Islands the natives simply slit up the
prepuce on its dorsal aspect, and in earlier times the
practice was to cut the prepuce all round the corona,
avoiding the frœnum. In the Fiji Islands the instrument
used is a sharp splinter of bamboo.</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon females the process of excision is performed by
aged women. In Egypt the custom is still maintained;
and the women of the <i>Said</i> travel about from town to
village, crying out “Circumcisor! who wants a circumcisor?”
In Old Calabar, Mr. Daniel had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>opportunity of witnessing the operation, which is likewise
performed <i>there</i> by aged females. The girl having been
placed on the knees of a woman, with the legs apart,
the clitoris was seized, <i>forceps-like</i>, by two pieces of
bamboo or palm-sticks, and being gently drawn forth,
was severed with a sharp razor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the Jews the peculiar and distinctive mark
of circumcision is perpetuated in our days, and without
any material change of ceremonial. The <i>modus operandi</i>
is as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span>The godfather being seated, takes the
child on his knees, and the operator (who may be the
father of the child, if capable, or some friend of the
family, or a professed expert) takes up with his fingers,
or a pair of tweezers, as much of the prepuce as he
intends to cut off, and, on applying the knife, says—“Blessed
be Thou, O God, who hast commanded us to
use circumcision.” He then sucks the blood, and spits
it into a cup of wine, and having applied styptics to the
wound, retakes the cup, and having blessed <i>it</i> and the
child, pronounces the name of the child, and moistens
his lips with the contents of the cup. Various prayers
are then said, and the ceremony is concluded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the modern Jews generally use a steel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>instrument, there is this remarkable exception—that, when a
male child dies before the eighth day, it is circumcised
prior to burial, and this is done, not with the ordinary
instrument, but with a fragment of glass or flint.</p>

<p class='c008'>The practice extended to the Ishmaelites, and, as we
have already stated, was subsequently adopted by
Mahomet, so that a very large section of the human
race are to this day, participators of a rite established
considerably more than 3000 years ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject cannot be dismissed without noticing the
fact that the Jews under their various captivities,
subjugations, and persecutions, endeavoured, in some
instances, to obliterate the marks of circumcision. This
is abundantly proved, not only by contemporary writers,
but by the evidence of Epiphanius, Celsus, Galen,
Paulus Ægineta, Fallopius, and others, who have
enlarged upon the means adopted for the accomplishment
of this object. It is, further, a noteworthy circumstance
that the Jews <i>entirely</i> suspended the practice
of circumcision during the forty years of their wanderings
in the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c008'>In contemplating the sufferings of this unfortunate
race, the heart sickens at the punishments which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>resulted from their resistance to foreign usurpation.
Unable to discern the hand of God in their humiliation,
their struggles were, indeed, hopeless, but not the less
heroic. Captives in Babylon, after a long and cruel
servitude, they were restored only to be again scattered
by the destruction of Jerusalem, under Titus. Through
the varying fortunes of the Romans, no resting-place
seems to have been vouchsafed to them; plundered and
disgraced, the fall of Rome only eventuated, as far as
<i>they</i> were concerned, in a change of masters. Ruthless
persecutors tracked them through the dark ages, and
what Heathenism spared, Christianity despoiled; our
pious ancestors praising God when they had a chance
of maltreating an Israelite.</p>

<p class='c008'>For these reasons, and with such incentives, can we
doubt that the timid amongst them would endeavour to
remove the means of identity which circumcision afforded.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have so refined away the simplicity of the patriarchal
times, that it is almost necessary to apologise
for alluding to the reverential awe with which all
matters relating to the seed of Abraham were regarded.
It was a solemn and impressive act when
the Patriarch, believing that the time was come for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>his son Isaac to have a wife, sent for his chief servant,
and said, “Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh,
and swear by the Lord that thou wilt choose a wife for
my son out of mine own kindred;” and the servant,
with his hand on his master’s genitals, took the required
oath; and we all know how faithfully he performed
it. Whilst this simple, but deeply significant
ceremony was being enacted, the heart of the father of
the faithful was doubtless filled with contemplations of
the great purposes for the accomplishment of which
the organs of generation were appropriately considered
as the direct agents.</p>

<p class='c008'>This mode of taking the oath is further adverted to
in the 47th chapter of Genesis, when Jacob is taking
his farewell of his children.</p>

<p class='c008'>In our blind adoration of classical heathenism we
undervalue the sublime and not less poetical incidents
which mark the rise, progress, culmination, and decay
of that people with whom our highest interests are
identified. If, for instance, the Book of Job had not
been written under inspiration, and had been accidentally
discovered among the ruins of the <i>first</i> Babylon, our
antiquarians would have regarded it as the loftiest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>epics; and especially so if, instead of inculcating the
worship of the true God, its subject had been the
glorification of whatever false deity might have been
in the ascendant when this most ancient poem was
composed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prejudices of education subjugate the judgment,
and the gross and sensual attributes with which the
Greek poets invested their deities, are accepted with
complacency, if not with admiration; even Pope, their
great panegyrist, describes their heroes <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Gods, partial, changeful, profligate, unjust,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Whose attributes were <i>rage</i>, <i>revenge</i>, and <i>lust</i>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This, of course, will be set down for rank blasphemy
against the canons of taste. We are exuberant in our
praises of the <i>genius</i> of Homer, and not to worship his
<i>inventive</i> powers is an offence of the deepest dye; but
when we are barbarous enough to critically examine
this wonderful mythology, and to determine the claims
to applause—say of supreme Jove—we are rather
troubled by the difficulty of reconciling the ways of
the first intelligence with our commonplace notions of
decency. The intrigues of the father of the gods, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>artifices by which he eludes the jealousy of his wife
Juno, his incestuous, and, if they were not classical,
we should call them filthy debaucheries, draw largely
upon our faith in the beauties of these records of high
Olympus; and our admiration for the poet is sadly tinctured
with disgust for the images in which his creative
powers are developed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus much of the ceremonial laws. Of the moral
law, the law of God, it becomes me not to speak; its
obligations are as eternal as its author; the everlasting
truths of the decalogue have been incorporated more or
less into every system of religion and ethics which has
been enunciated during the ages interposing between
us and the period in which they were first promulgated
on Mount Sinai.</p>

<p class='c008'>In dismissing Moses and his times, I crave your
particular attention to the manner in which the characters
of priest and physician met in the same person.
As we proceed we shall find that this junction of attributes
continues through all the variations of time
and circumstances. The terrors of the <i>unseen</i>, overawing
the ignorant, placed them at the mercy of those daring
minds which in every age have assumed the office of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>interpreters of the will of the <i>demon</i>, or the behests of
the benign Deity. To deal as a mediator between the
threats of the terrible avenger and the awe-stricken
victim of his own bewildered imagination, to avert the
consequences of the threatened storm, or to turn aside
any other manifestation of approaching evil is the office
of the <i>medicine-man</i> of the North American Indian and
the <i>Obeah</i> doctor of the African. Shrewd observers of
nature, these wretched impostors monopolize the whole
of the intelligence, such as it is, of the hordes of the
human race upon whom the light of reason has never
dawned, or has dawned in vain.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is yet another aspect of the medical character,
infinitely more agreeable and important, and the consideration
of it will bring us to the times immediately
preceding the days of the father of medicine. I do not
propose to penetrate into the story of Esculapius and
his divine origin, which probably, in an esoteric sense,
merely meant that the Giver of all good had inspired
him with a knowledge of the healing art; but (with a
passing glance at Homer, the greatest poet of his own
or any subsequent age), proceed to offer some general
observations on the position which the study of medicine
acquired under the tutorship of the philosophers.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The siege of Troy is supposed to have taken place
about three hundred years before the <i>Iliad</i> was sung,
and in that early time it appears that the cultivation of
our art formed part of the general education of kings
and warriors.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Homer introduces us to Machaon the son of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Esculapius, who, when Menelaus was treacherously wounded
by Pandarus, is called to his aid:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When the wound appeared in sight, where struck</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The stinging arrow, from the clotted blood</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He cleansed it, and applied with skilful hand</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The healing ointments, which, in friendly guise,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The learned <i>Chiron</i> to his father gave.”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Making due allowance for the debasing fable with
which every great name or talent is overlaid, it is
rational to suppose that Chiron, the teacher of Esculapius,
was one of those shepherd philosophers, who like
their Babylonian brethren absorbed all the knowledge
of the times; but Homer gives us other examples in
support of this idea. Chiron was the preceptor of
Achilles, and when Machaon is himself wounded, Patroclus
is sent by Achilles to his assistance; on his
arrival he is urged by Eurypylus, to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Draw the deadly dart,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With luke-warm water wash the gore away:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With healing balm the raging smart allay,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Such as sage <i>Chiron</i>, sire of pharmacy,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Once taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.”—<i>Pope.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>He also complains that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Of two great <i>surgeons</i>, Podalirius stands</div>
      <div class='line in1'>This hour surrounded by the Trojan bands,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And great <i>Machaon</i> wounded in his tent</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Now wants the succour which so oft he lent.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Patroclus cut the forky steel away,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And in his hand a bitter root he pressed,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The wound he washed and styptic juice infused,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The wound to torture and the blood to flow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Machaon seems to have largely shared the goodwill of
the Grecian hosts. Nestor, in his anxiety, <span class="nowrap">says:—</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>A wise Physician skilled in wounds to heal,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Is more than <i>armies</i> to the public weal.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Military leaders in our days have no such weakness as
this. Studied neglect seems to them the befitting
recompense of those on whom they must necessarily
rely for the health and sanitary welfare of their troops.</p>

<p class='c008'>As we are still in the age of fable, it may not be out
of place to notice with what tenacity the human mind
clings to those delusions which fear engenders, and
weak hopes sustain: with all our boasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>enlightenment, the <i>marvellous</i> and the <i>incredible</i> have more
worshippers than the <i>real</i> and the <i>true</i>. Let us not
wonder then, that the pure monotheism enunciated in
the Holy Scriptures had so little charm for the sensuous
and imaginative Greeks. Socrates, who, by the
simple force of reason and philosophy had reached the
very portals of the temple in which was enshrined the
idea of the unity of God, in his <i>last hour</i> “sacrifices
a cock to Esculapius.” The reputed offspring of an
impure deity, History is unhappily more abundant in
records of human folly and superstition, than in examples
of purity of thought and action—simplicity is
everywhere despised—facts are distorted or made subservient
to sensations; for <span class="nowrap">example:—</span>It is not enough
to tell us that Chiron was skilled in physic, but to suit
the depraved appetites of the vulgar he is a <i>centaur</i>,
and Esculapius a <i>god</i>. It is therefore with something
like relief that the name of Hippocrates comes before
us, for in him we have a <i>reality</i>, and in his works a
remarkable record of the condition of medical science
in the fifth century before Christ. He was born at Cos,
a small island off the coast of Caria, not in Greece
proper, in the first year of the 80th Olympiad.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Hippocrates was descended from Esculapius by his
father’s side, and from Hercules by his mother’s, and
was the son of Heraclides, a physician of the family
of the Asclepiadæ, who furnish us with the very
earliest instance of a body of philosophers devoting
themselves to the healing art; for, although Pythagoras,
who lived immediately before Hippocrates, and
Democritus, who was his contemporary, were both
learned physicians, yet, whatever fame they acquired,
was ascribed to their powers as mental philosophers
and rhetoricians.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been urged by way of apology for the mystery
in which the philosophers shrouded their wisdom, that
“science, like modesty, should cover itself with a veil
to increase the charms of the treasure it conceals;”
and this principle has been, throughout all ages, more
generally acted upon than avowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The character of Hippocrates is at once a study for
the physician and the moralist; the former will appreciate
the astonishing evidences which his works afford,
of a deep acquaintance with the whole subject of medicine,
and his admiration will be increased by the remembrance
that all the principles laid down by this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>great and good man, were the results of his own experience.</p>

<p class='c008'>No treatises on disease existed anterior to his time
to aid him in his investigations of the phenomena of
nature, although it is true that in the Asclepion or
temple of Esculapius at Cos, records were kept and
votive tablets preserved commemorative of cures performed,
and of the remedies by which they were
effected. But if the physician admires his talents,
the moralist does honour to the qualities of his mind
and the goodness of his heart. Benevolent and disinterested,
pious towards the gods, and incorruptibly
devoted to his country, he instructed his <a id='corr34.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='original: fellow-men'>fellow men</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_34.13'>fellow men</a></span>,
not by shedding maudlin tears over their follies, like
Heraclides, nor by the coarse laughter of his friend
Democritus, but by a calm and even walk of life, mitigating
sorrow by his skill, and showing the form and
beauty of virtue by his example.</p>

<p class='c008'>His portrait of a worthy physician may well serve for
his own likeness, and in its description we shall observe
that the exalted principles of professional ethics therein
inculcated, are as strictly applicable to our own times
as they were to those which he himself enlightened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and adorned. His words <span class="nowrap">are:—</span>“The physician who is
an honour to his profession, is he who has merited the
public esteem by profound knowledge, long experience,
consummate integrity, and irreproachable life; who,
esteeming all the wretched as equals in the eyes of the
Divine Being, hastens to their assistance, speaks with
mildness, listens with attention, bears with their impatience,
and inspires that confidence which sometimes
of itself restores life; sensibly alive to their sufferings,
carefully studies the causes and progress of the complaint;
not disconcerted by unforseen accidents, but,
in emergencies, having exhausted his own resources,
holds it a duty to call in his brethren of the healing
art to assist him with their advice. Having struggled
with all his strength against the malady, he is happy
and modest in success, and in failure congratulates
himself that he has, at least, alleviated the sufferings
of his patient.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the great obstacles to the advancement of
anatomy and physiology was the universal reverence
for the dead which the Greeks and Romans shared in
common with all the people of antiquity. Among the
Jews, to touch a dead body exposed the offender to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>penance of seven days’ exclusion and privation from
the ordinary comforts of life; and it is almost superfluous
to add, that the Egyptians made this reverence
a part of their religion.</p>

<p class='c008'>He, then, who ventured on the dissection of the
human body, did so at great personal risk, and for
more than 600 years after the foundation of Rome,
no instance is known of the existence of any public
professor of anatomy. About that time Archagathus,
a Greek, practised surgery in Rome; and it appears
that his use of the knife, and the actual cautery, was
so abhorrent to the general feeling, that he was saluted
with the opprobrious title of “Carnifex.” Even in
later days the learned Tertullian classed anatomists
and butchers together in a philippic he pronounced
against Herophilus, whom he charged with having
tried experiments on the living body. He <span class="nowrap">commences:—</span>“Herophilus,
the physician, or butcher,
whichever you please, who to become better acquainted
with men, ripped them up alive,” &#38;c. &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of this same Herophilus, who appears to have been
a man of humour, as well as genius, there is an excellent
story <span class="nowrap">told:—</span>A certain <i>Diodorus</i>, a contemporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>philosopher and teacher of paradoxes, declared that there
was no such thing as <i>motion</i>. “If a body <i>moves</i>,” says
he, “it moves into the place where it <i>is</i>, <i>or</i> into the
place where it <i>is not</i>; now it does not move into the
place where it <i>is</i>, for what is <i>in</i> a place <i>remains</i> there,
and, consequently, one cannot say that <i>it moves</i>. It
also cannot move in a place where <i>it is not</i>; and therefore,
it does not move at all.” This acute gentleman
having dislocated his arm, begged the services of Herophilus,
who, smiling, <span class="nowrap">said:—</span>“Either the bone of your
arm is moved into the place where it <i>was</i>, or into the
place where it <i>was not</i>; now it cannot move, according
to your principles, either in one place or another, consequently
it is not displaced at all.” The poor teacher
of paradoxes saw that Herophilus was laughing at him,
and in an agony cried <span class="nowrap">out:—</span>“Leave, I pray you, <i>dialectics</i>
and <i>sophisms</i> to me, and treat me according to
the laws of medicine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The inference that dissection was not openly allowed,
will be strengthened by a short reference to the subject
of the embalmment of the dead—the first mention of this
custom is found in the 50th Chapter of Genesis; where,
at the second verse, we <span class="nowrap">read:—</span>That “Joseph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his
father, and the physicians embalmed Israel;” and at
26th verse of the same chapter it is <span class="nowrap">written:—</span>“So
Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old, and
they embalmed him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Egyptians believed that so long as the human
body could be saved from putrefaction or decay, the
soul of that body continued in existence; and from
this feeling arose the custom of embalming, so common
in remote ages. The embalmer was, in a certain
sense, a <i>sacred</i> functionary; nevertheless, it was the
fashion to make a show of resistance, when he began
his operation, in order to mark the innate horror of
any, however necessary, profanation of the dead body.
Herodotus relates that in Egypt the mummy embalmers
made the incision in the side of the corpse with a sharp
æthiopic stone. Of these stones two varieties have
been found in the tombs in Egypt, both of chipped
flint, and very neatly made. One kind is like a very
small cleaver; the other has more of the character of a
lancet. The account given by Diodorus Siculus of the
resistance offered to the embalmer is, as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span>“And
first, the body being laid on the ground, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>who is called the scribe marks on its left side how far
the incision is to be made; then the so-called slitter
(paraschistes) having an æthiopic stone, and cutting
the flesh as far as the law allows, instantly runs off,
the bystanders pursuing him, and pelting him with
stones, cursing him, and, as it were, turning the horror
of the deed upon him, for he who hurts a citizen is
held worthy of abhorrence.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Immediately after death
the corpse was put into the hands of the embalmer,
who in the presence of the friends of the deceased,
made an incision into the left side, as above described,
through which he extracted all the intestines, leaving
the heart and kidneys; the intestines were then washed
in palm wine, and a solution of astringent gums. The
<i>brain</i> was removed through the nostrils by means of a
hooked instrument, contrived for the purpose, and the
cavity filled with aromatic oils. The body was now
anointed with spice-oils and balsamic gums (frankincense
being prohibited), and allowed to remain for
thirty days, after which it was immersed in a solution
of nitre for from forty to seventy days (the latter being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the extreme limit allowed); it was then enveloped in
aromatised cere-cloths, and all being ready, consigned
to the coffin, on which were painted emblems indicative
of the condition of the deceased. The process is said
to have cost £300 of our money, and was, of course,
only applicable to the rich. The fee for embalmment
alone, varied from a <i>Talent</i> (which has been estimated
by some as equivalent to £193 15s., and by others to
£243 15s. of our present money) to a <i>Mina</i>, in value
about £3 4s. 7d.</p>

<p class='c008'>The embalmment of the middle classes was, in some
degree, regulated by their means; the simplest form
being, the destruction of the intestines with strong oil
of tar, and after their removal soaking the body in a
strong solution of nitre for a period not exceeding
seventy days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some have ascribed the practice of embalming to the
fact of the periodical inundations of the Nile rendering
interment impossible at such seasons, and hence have
thought that necessity had quite as much to do with
the custom as the religious principle: but this idea is
not well founded, for although the Nile continues to
overflow, embalmings have ceased for ages.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>After Hippocrates the name of Aristotle comes
before us. Aristotle, the pupil and friend of the
venerable Plato, whose doctrines he adopted and developed,
lectured at Athens 370 years before Christ.
As a physician and naturalist he was far in advance
of his contemporaries, and as a mathematician and
moral philosopher, his transcendent learning was, for
ages, the theme of every scholar; and his “System
of the Universe” adopted by the whole of the civilized
world. These great qualities attracted the attention
of Philip of Macedonia, who chose him as the
tutor of his son Alexander (the Great). Ignorance
and superstition were, however, omnipotent, and for
having enunciated the doctrine of one God, and a
supreme first cause, the priests of the various temples
seeing their craft in danger, excited the populace, who
threatened his life. Warned by the fate of Socrates,
he retired to Chalcis to wear away a life embittered
by personal suffering, and sorrow for the folly and ingratitude
of his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The heart’s deepest feelings are roused at the remembrance
of the deeds of violence perpetrated against
every benefactor of mankind who has had the courage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>to promulgate truths beyond the comprehension of the
vulgar on the one hand, and opposed to the vested
interest of established errors on the other. The fate
of Aristotle is a common result, not confined to the
dark ages, nor without examples amongst ourselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>The learned Philo of Alexandria, who lived <span class="nowrap"><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 40,</span>
has given us an interesting account of the very remarkable
sect living in Egypt in his day, known as
the “Theraputæ,” or “healers.” He describes them
as a confraternity who, after having received a special
training in the University of Alexandria, devoted themselves
to the healing art; they led a secluded, contemplative
life, and laid the foundation of the monastic
system. Eusebius calls them Christians, but this is
not confirmed by Philo, who was a member of the
sect; they were, probably, Platonists, or philosophical
pagans. They ascribed their cures to prayers, fastings,
and incantations, eschewed all material remedies, and
medicaments, but made free use of magical rites of
both forms—the leucomancy, or white magic, used in
invoking the gods, and necromancy when the demons
were to be propitiated or coerced. St. Luke, before
his conversion, is supposed to have been a Therapeut;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and St. Paul denounces some of their errors. Of their
faults we cannot judge, but we may admire the benevolence
with which they devoted themselves alike to
the physical and moral welfare of their fellow men—in
this respect, no unworthy forerunners of Him who
commanded his disciples, not only to “instruct the
ignorant,” but to “heal the sick.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We pass over three centuries to come to the time
of Celsus, who, in the reign of Tiberius and the first
century of our Lord, was established at Rome; where
he acquired great honour and renown. To these he
was fairly entitled by the extent of his learning and
the especial attention he paid to surgery and medicine.
His principles governed the medical world without a
rival until the time of Galen, who divided the empire
with him for centuries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Celsus was the first native Roman physician whose
name has been transmitted to us: the practice of
medicine and surgery being, prior to his time, in the
hands of eminent Greeks and Asiatics, excepting that
there existed in Rome (at that period) a race of native
practitioners, who belonged to the class of slaves<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>persons of low degree; and to whom were entrusted
only the subordinate branches of the healing art.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great proficiency of Celsus on the subjects of
rhetoric, philosophy, military tactics, and rural economy,
as mentioned by Quintilian, has induced many
of our older writers to doubt whether he ever really
practised medicine and surgery, or, whether, like the
elder Cato, he simply studied them as a branch of
general knowledge; and this scepticism has been
favoured by the fact of his name being omitted by
Pliny, in his “Treatise on the History of Medicine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, no one, I think, can rise from
the perusal of his celebrated work, “De Medicina,”
without being thoroughly convinced that his intimate
acquaintance with the theory and practice of medicine,
surgery, and pharmacy, could only have resulted from
close bedside observation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Galen was born at Pergamos, in Asia, in the second
century; his learning was great, and his literary labours
enormous. Having traversed Egypt and Greece, and
acquired a knowledge of every science taught in the
schools there, he settled in Rome. His works have
been estimated at over 300 volumes—medical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>physical, and metaphysical. He practised bleeding more
frequently than his predecessors, but he gave very
careful directions as to the conditions under which
venesection should be resorted to, as well as to the
quantity of blood to be taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>Averroes, Avicenna, and other Arabian physicians
held him in great veneration; and Dr. Alison <span class="nowrap">says:—</span>
“For centuries after his death his doctrines and tenets
were regarded in the light of oracles, which few persons
had the courage to oppose; and the authority of
Galen alone was estimated at a much higher rate than
that of all the medical writers combined, who flourished
during a period of more than twelve centuries.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rome, in its decadence, was too much occupied with
the intrigues and villainies of the factions by which it
was ultimately destroyed, to spare any time for the
culture of science. It was not until after the total
disappearance of the Eastern Empire, and the hollow
tranquillity which succeeded the triumphs of Mahomet,
and the subsequent subjugation of Spain by the Moors,
that learning reared its head in Alexandria, and the
Arabian physicians came into view.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although Greece had disappeared, even in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>noonday of its glory, its literature never possessed more
devoted admirers, nor more faithful exponents than
are to be found among the Arabian philosophers,
and yet what a striking contrast is exhibited in the
characters of the two people. Whilst making the
philosophy of Greece their own, they by no means lost
their distinctiveness and individuality. The Greeks
delighted in all that was brilliant and fascinating, like
the beautiful scenery of Attica and Asia Minor. The
Arabs were thoughtful and grave, monotonous and
arid, like the deserts they inhabited. The genius of
poetry illumined all the meditations of the former,
and their thoughts were graceful, even in their errors;
whilst the reflections of the latter were dull and melancholy,
albeit they were based on truths.</p>

<p class='c008'>A dreary night now ensues—we have no name of
note until Paulus Ægineta in 640—but what a series
of historically grand events interpose: The invasion
of Europe by the Huns—Division of the Roman Empire—Taking
of Rome by Alaric—Visigoths established
in Spain—Saxon heptarchy begun—Conquest of Italy
by Totila—Birth of Mahomet, down to the taking of
Alexandria by the Arabs—Greece and Rome having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>virtually disappeared; and our next author (Paulus)
probably present at the burning of the great library of
the Ptolemies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Paulus Ægineta is entitled to our homage, as the
author of an abridgment of the works of Galen, and
many excellent treatises on medical subjects, especially
on those incident to childbed, and the diseases
of women; he was the first writer upon <i>small-pox</i> and
<i>measles</i>, and the originator of the theory of <i>zymosis</i>,
which has received so much attention of late. Paulus
died about the middle of the seventh century, and with
him expired the last of the Greek writers upon medicine.
His labours have been thought worthy of being
translated by the Sydenham Society.</p>

<p class='c008'>Avicenna, who lived in the year 980, deserves a
fuller notice than we can afford him; his works are
said to present great clearness and acuteness. At the
early age of eighteen he was chosen Physician to the
Court of the Caliph of Bagdad, where for some offence
he was imprisoned, and ultimately died. He has been
called the “Hippocrates of the Arabs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rhazes was contemporary with Avicenna, and has
attracted the respectful attention of the lovers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>ancient medicine. His most esteemed work is a
treatise on small-pox, which was translated by Dr.
Mead in 1548.</p>

<p class='c008'>I will conclude these sketches of the Arabian schoolmen
with a brief notice of Averroes, the most eminent
of <span class="nowrap">them:—</span></p>

<p class='c008'>This profound scholar was born at Cordova, in Spain,
of which city his father was the alcade, about the year
1120. He was educated in Morocco, then in its glory,
and in the celebrated schools there studied law, philosophy,
and medicine. His admiration for Aristotle was
unbounded, and his unwearied application to the examination
of that great man’s works, secured for him
the reputation of being the ablest commentator on the
Aristotelian philosophy. He rose to the dignity of a
judge in Morocco, but the freedom of his opinions
being in advance of the age, he was imprisoned for
some years, and only released on recanting his errors;
he died 1206, during the Caliphate of Almanzer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The glories of the Moorish power now began to wane,
and after repeated discomfitures in 1516, that intelligent
and highly civilized people were finally expelled
by Ferdinand the Catholic: the cross triumphs—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>crescent retires, and takes with it all that is admirable
in arts, or humanizing in science; the Spaniard has
chased away Mahomet, and receives the Inquisition as
the first-fruits of his conquest.</p>

<p class='c008'>The war against opinion was carried on so vigorously
that Copernicus, whose acute perception had discovered
the errors of Aristotle’s theory of heavenly bodies,
was fiercely denounced. Copernicus was born in Westphalia
in 1473, he studied at Cracow, where he received
the degree of Doctor of Medicine; at Bologna his piercing
genius discovered that the sun was the centre of
the planetary system, that the earth was a planet and
revolved round the sun like other planets, and thus
was first made known the true system of the universe.
These discoveries being distasteful to the church, the
Pope issued a sentence of excommunication; and the
great astronomer died with a heart oppressed by such
unmerited persecution.</p>

<p class='c008'>These discoveries were further pursued by another
learned physician, Galileo, who was born at Pisa in
1564. He entered the university there in 1581, and
prosecuted his studies with such zeal and success, that
in a very few years he became Professor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Mathematics. He now began his career as a teacher of
the philosophy of Copernicus, and soon received unpleasant
evidences that the disciple of truth must be
ready to suffer. A congregation of cardinals, monks,
and mathematicians of the old school, determined that
his works were heretical and dangerous, and the holy
inquisition sentenced him to prison. After remaining
incarcerated some months he was taken before his
judges, and required to renounce his errors, and with
his hand upon the Gospel, to swear that they were
sinful and detestable. Having performed this horrid
penance, his conscience upbraided him, and as he rose
from his knees, he exclaimed, “yet it does move,”
for which relapse he was further sentenced to perpetual
imprisonment. He continued thus secluded for many
years, during which time blindness, deafness, and pains
in his limbs embittered his existence, and death at
length, more merciful than the Holy See, released him
from his trials. Newton was born in the year in which
this noble martyr died.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the edification of the worshippers of the “good
old times,” a few more instances of the loving kindness
which prevailed may be acceptable.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The clerical sages of the University of Salamanca
pronounced that the assertion of Christopher Columbus,
that a continent existed beyond the seas, was
blasphemous and feloniously wicked. A bishop of
Salsburg expressing his belief in the existence of the
antipodes was denounced by the bishop of Mentz as a
dangerous heretic, and committed to the flames.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bigotry, however, is not confined to any one creed,
since we know that Calvin the reformer, a man who had
suffered persecution without learning mercy, no sooner
found himself invested with the power to punish the
freedom of thought in which he had himself indulged,
than he persecuted to death the learned physician,
Michael Servetus, not for any immoral proclivity, but
because he believed him to be unsound on the doctrine
of the Trinity. Servetus took the degree of Doctor of
Medicine at the University of Paris about the year
1535. He is the author of some medical treatises on
the circulation of the blood, and also translated Ptolemy’s
geography; he was for some time in constant
correspondence with Calvin, but as the “Odium theologicum”
is the bitterest, Calvin shewed his christian
charity by causing his antagonist to be consigned to
the flames.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>But I must hasten forward, Fallopius looms in the
distance, and with him our medical celebrities come
fast and numerous. Gabriel Fallopius was born at
Modena about the year 1523, and was one of the great
triad of anatomists in Italy who, at the close of the
16th century, laid the foundation of the modern science
of anatomy. Fallopius succeeded Vesalius in the
chair of anatomy and surgery at Padua in 1557. His
career was brilliant but short, and he died in 1562. It
should be mentioned that Fallopius shared the usual
fate of great discoverers; his originality was disputed,
and his learning questioned; but it has been always
so, and in appreciating the works of our predecessors,
we must keep in view the enormous difficulties by
which every onward step, whether in art or science,
is beset:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Envy doth merit, as its shade pursue.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>truth does indeed ultimately prevail, but too frequently
the heart of the discoverer is broken before
the obtuseness of the mediocrities in power, by whom
it is obstructed, can be overcome.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although a little diverging from the strict chronological
order, I must here introduce to you our old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>acquaintance, Paracelsus; this eccentric genius had
too little virtue to be admired, and too much talent
to be despised. He was born at Zurich, in Switzerland,
in 1493, and was consequently contemporary
with many more learned, but less celebrated men;
an unblushing and presumptuous egotist, he presents
himself, in a moral point of view, as the exact antithesis
of the amiable and virtuous Hippocrates. That
he made some very useful discoveries must be granted
to him; he introduced the use of opium into Germany,
and was the first practitioner who employed preparations
of mercury, antimony, sulphur, iron, and other
remedies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Van Helmont is the most indulgent of his biographers,
and Lord Bacon the most severe; but
perhaps the description given by Zimmerman comes
nearest the truth—“Paracelsus burnt publicly at <i>Bàle</i>
the works of Galen, Avicenna, and other eminent
predecessors, because, he said, ‘they knew nothing
of the cabballa and magic,’ which lay at the root of
all medical and natural laws. He undertook to cure
all diseases by the use of certain words and charms.
He enjoined secresy on his disciples, and certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>was the first <i>great quack</i> from whom the numerous
band of Charlatans have proceeded.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He has left his mantle behind him, and his descendants,
with none of his brains, have largely inherited his
presumption. On the occasion of his inauguration in
the Chair of Medicine, he thus expresses <span class="nowrap">himself:—</span></p>

<p class='c008'>“Know,” says he, “that my <i>cap</i> has more learning
than all your professors, and my beard more experience
than all your academies! I speak to you Greeks,
Latins, Frenchmen, Italians, &#38;c. &#38;c. <i>You</i> will follow
<i>me</i>, <i>I</i> shall not follow <i>you</i>. You, I say, doctors of
Paris, Montpellier, Dalmatia, of Athens; you Jews,
Arabs, Spaniards, English, I tell you all that nature
obeys me; and if God does not deign to assist, I have
yet the devil to resort to. I am king of all science,
and command all the hosts of hell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We have in this impostor the very embodiment of the
true quacks of to-day; their language is indeed a little
subdued, but their pretensions are as large; and, let
me add, that whereas Paracelsus, in his days, had the
countenance and support of many persons of rank, so
in ours, there does not exist an ignorant pretender
without the patronage of the great, and this patronage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>too often, in the exact ratio of his presumption and
falsehood.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must not be overlooked that this arch imposter
died miserably, in poverty, induced by dissipation, and
the possessor of the “elixir of immortality” breathed
out his drunken soul at the age of fifty.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have a lively picture of the state of things
begotten of this man in the pages of Burton, an
example in himself of the power of credulity, and a
proof that great scholastic learning was by no means
at variance with the wild vagaries of the times. He
appears not unconscious of his peculiarities, and offers
the following apology for his frequent reference to
callings other than his <span class="nowrap">own:—</span></p>

<p class='c008'>“If any physician shall infer ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne sutor ultra crepidam,</span>’

<p class='c008'>Burton lived about 1576, and was consequently of
the same age as our own great <a id='corr56.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='original: Hervey'>Harvey</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_56.11'>Harvey</a></span>, of whom we
shall speak presently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me offer you one specimen on the subject of
demoniacal possession, first introducing you to a new
character, Cornelius Gemma, who was born at Louvain
in 1535, and was one of the greatest scholars of his
age, a professor of medicine in his native town (the
chair having been conferred upon him by the great
Duke of Alva, who governed the low countries), and
whose writings embrace the subjects of medicine,
mathematics, magic, and spiritual possession. Like
Cardan, he was thought a little extreme in some
views, but this one example suffices to demonstrate
the evil influences of Paracelsus. Gemma, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>second book on natural miracles, <span class="nowrap">says:—</span>“A young
maid, called Katherine Gualter, a cooper’s daughter,
in the year 1571, had such strange passions that three
men could not hold her. She purged a live eel—I
myself saw and touched—a foot and a half long; she
vomited twenty-four pounds of fulsome stuff of all
colours twice a day for fourteen days, and after that
great <i>balls of hair</i>, <i>pieces of wood</i>, <i>pigeons’ dung</i>, <i>coals</i>,
and after them <i>two pounds</i> of pure blood, and then
again coals and stones (<i>of which some had inscriptions</i>)
bigger than a walnut. All this I saw with horror.
Physic could do no good, so she was handed over to
the clergy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Marcellus Donatus relates a story of a country fellow
who had four knives in his belly, every one a span
long, and indented like a saw; also a wreath of hair,
and much other baggage. How they “came into his
guts” he knew not.</p>

<p class='c008'>This personal testimony of Gemma is a melancholy
proof that the light of christianity, during fifteen centuries,
had done but little towards the emancipation of
the human mind from the trammels of superstition,
for, we find Josephus, who lived <span class="nowrap"><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 30,</span> also favoring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>us with his <i>personal</i> testimony to facts quite as marvellous,
and no doubt as veracious, as those recorded
by our Dutch philosopher. Yet although common
sense rejects such “materials of history” where shall
we look for better evidence of authenticity than is
thus furnished by two men of unimpeachable integrity.
The pride of enlightenment is indeed checked by the
reflection that <span class="nowrap"><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1867</span> we hear of believers in
“Spiritual Manifestation” not only among the vulgar
but in classes of society where the yearning after the
mysterious sets both reason and philosophy at defiance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The universality of belief in the existence of demons,
and their occasional possession of the bodies of men,
pervades the whole course of sacred and profane history,
and Josephus, in enumerating the great qualities of
King Solomon, bears testimony to the power of the
Jewish Monarch as an “<i>Exorcist</i>:”—After informing
us that Solomon exceeded all men in knowledge of
natural things, that he was familiar with every sort of
tree, from the cedar to the hyssop on the wall; that he
knew the habits of every living creature, whether upon
the earth, or in the seas, or in the air, and described
their several attributes like a philosopher, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>demonstrated his exquisite knowledge of them; he goes on
to <span class="nowrap">say:—</span>“God also gave him understanding to attain
to skill against demons for the benefit of mankind; for
having composed incantations, whereby diseases are
removed, he also left behind him certain kinds of
exorcisms whereby demons may be expelled so as
never to return, and this method of cure is effectual
or prevails much among us to this day: for <i>I saw</i> one
Eleazar, my countryman, in the presence of Vespasian
and his sons, and many tribunes and other soldiers,
deliver men who were seized by these demons. The
cure was in this <span class="nowrap">manner:—</span>Applying to the nostrils
of the demoniacs a ring, having under the seal one of
those roots of which Solomon taught the virtues, he
drew out the demon from the nostrils of the man who
smelled to <span class="nowrap">it:—</span>The man presently falling down, the
Exorcist mentioned the name of <i>Solomon</i>, and reciting
the charms composed by <i>him</i>, adjured the demon never
to <span class="nowrap">return:—</span>Moreover Eleazar, to satisfy all the company
of his power, placed a small vessel full of water,
in which feet are washed, and commanded the demon
as he went out of the man to overthrow it, that all
present might be sensible that he had left the man:
this being done the wisdom of Solomon was manifest.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>In the seventh book of his “Wars of the Jews,” he
gives us the following account of one of the roots employed
by <span class="nowrap">Exorcists:—</span>“On the north side of the City
of Machœrus there is a valley, in which is a place
called Baaras, in which is found a plant bearing the
same name: it is of a flaming colour and towards
evening shines very bright: it is not easy to be
gathered for it withdraws itself and does not stay
unless one pours upon it the urine of a woman, or
<a id='corr60.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='original: menstrous'>menstruous</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_60.10'>menstruous</a></span> blood, and even then it is certain death
to him who takes it unless he carries the root hanging
down upon the hand—There is another way of getting
it without <span class="nowrap">danger:—</span>They dig all round it, so that a
very little bit of the root is left in the ground, then
they tie a dog to it, and the dog attempting to follow
him who tied it, the root is easily pulled up, but the
dog dies presently, as it were, instead of the man who
would get the plant, afterwards there is no danger to
those who touch it. With all these dangers the root is
desirable, for demons, as they are called, who are the
spirits of wicked men entering into the living, and
killing those who have no help, this root presently
expels; if it be only brought near to them who are
diseased.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>We have already shewn how it took the devils by
the nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before we proceed, it may not be out of place to
notice the general belief in astrology, and especially
lunar influences, which prevailed at this period. Herbs
and roots had their several patrons, and it was only
when gathered and preserved under certain prescribed
circumstances that their specific virtues were assured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Similar superstitions are not yet extinct; even in
this year of grace, 1867, we are not quite emancipated
from the ignorance of the middle ages, and it is not
a very unusual thing to see an advertisement in the
<i>Times</i> announcing a “child’s caul” for sale. These
and such like absurdities,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Though it make the unskilful laugh,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Cannot but make the judicious grieve.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Nor is this credulity confined to the illiterate classes.
The dupes of St. John Long, as many of us may
remember, included “potent, grave, and reverend
signiors,” and on his memorable trial, a certain noble
lord<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> gave evidence that Mr. Long had extracted a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>piece of lead from his head. Some scoffers think it a
pity that the quack, having succeeded to some extent,
left so much behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>In speaking of Harvey, it is difficult to strike out
any new path in a tale that has been told so often.
Yet, we may extract something out of the consideration
of the times in which he lived, and the men by
whom he was surrounded. He was born at Folkestone,
in 1578, and commenced his travels at 19 years of age.
What his previous education had been does not appear,
but we find him at the age of 24 elected Doctor of
Medicine at Padua—then the most famous University
in the world. On his return to England he received
the honour of the degree of Doctor of Medicine at
Cambridge. James the First, and his son, Charles the
First, favoured him with their countenance, and in
1628 he was induced to publish an account of his
great discovery. As a matter of course he was at
once denounced as a visionary; personal abuse was
unsparingly poured upon him; but as the grand fact
enunciated was not to be shaken, his enemies turned
round and discovered that, after all, it was not new,
and had been the doctrine of many eminent physicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>from the earliest days. The old, old story: the same
sickening detraction—the same miserable envy rife in
every age and clime. Harvey died in 1658.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shakespeare was 14 years old when Harvey was
born, and the garrulous but erudite Burton was about
the same age, yet strange to say, the great poet seems
to have been unknown to the men of his own generation:
scholars knew nothing of poor players, and he
who was born to delight and instruct the future of
mankind shone with but small lustre then.</p>

<p class='c008'>The history of medicine in England now begins,
although for some time subsequently medical instruction
was sought for in the schools of Italy, France and
Holland. The Reformation had swept away the monastic
institutions; but during the depressing middle
ages, all the learning that barbarism had spared took
refuge in the cloister. The monks practised physic
very extensively, and considering the ignorance and
superstition of the period, it was natural that the
vulgar should prefer the medical assistance of those
who arrogated to themselves the immediate assistance
of Heaven in the preparation of their remedies. The
women were especially fond of consulting the monks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>if there be any truth in the old epigram:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To Esculapian monks the good wives roam</div>
      <div class='line in1'>What marvel, they have husbands sick at home.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The alchymists again, like their lineal descendants in
our days, professed to have discovered the philosophers
stone, and <i>universal specifics</i>, and they were, as they
are now, believed in proportion to their presumption.
The practice of medicine being chiefly engrossed by
empirics and monks, the latter very readily obtained
licenses from the Bishops of the various dioceses who
had authority to examine candidates, without having
themselves any knowledge of the subjects in question,
beyond that acquired in their general education.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the 5th Henry VIII., chap. vi., we find there
were but twelve regular Surgeons practising in all
London, and about the same number of Physicians.</p>

<p class='c008'>The college of Physicians in London owes its foundation
to Dr. Thomas Linacre, of All Soul’s, Oxford, a
man of profound learning, who had won honours at
Rome, Bologna, and Florence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Linacre, through his interest with Wolsey, a wise
and liberal patron of learning, obtained, in 1518, letters
patent from Henry the Eighth, constituting a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>corporate body of regular Physicians in London. He was
elected the first president, and meetings were held at
his house in Knight Ryder Street until his death.
With a munificence not without many worthy imitators
in our profession, as we shall presently point out, he
bequeathed this house to the College.</p>

<p class='c008'>His successor in the presidential chair was one of
those bright lights who have contributed largely to
the fame of medicine, in what I have already called
its social and scientific aspect, and therefore deserves
a passing notice. Dr. John Caius Kaye, of Gonville
Hall, Cambridge, was Court Physician to Edward the
Sixth, and as he retained the favour of Mary, after the
demise of the pious young King, he procured from her
a license to advance Gonville Hall into a <i>College</i> under
the name of Gonville and Caius College, on condition
of enlarging the institution at his own expense. In
order to devote himself to this object, he resigned the
presidency of the College of Physicians, and completed
his buildings at Cambridge. The mansion of learning
thus raised by his liberality, became the retreat of his
old age, and having given up the dignified position of
<i>Master</i>, with a disinterestedness equalled only by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>generosity, he continued to reside there as a gentleman
commoner until his death in 1573.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harvey was elected president of the College of Physicians
in 1654, but excused himself on account of his
age and infirmities. Such, however, was his attachment
to that body (best evinced by <i>donationes inter
vivos</i>), that in 1656, he made over his personal estate
in perpetuity for its use, having previously (on the
occasion of the College being removed from Knight
Ryder Street to Amen Corner) built them a library
and public hall,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> which he granted for ever to the
corporation, together with his own valuable collection
of books and instruments. Harvey’s grand result was
the work of a quarter of a century of unremitting toil.
An admirer <span class="nowrap">wrote:—</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There didst thou trace the blood, and first behold</div>
      <div class='line in1'>What dreams mistaken sages coined of old.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For till thy Pegasus the fountain brake,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The crimson blood was but a crimson lake,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which first from thee did tyde and motion gaine,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>Fam’d circulator of the lesser world.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He died in 1658.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>I may here mention, that, after the fire of London,
the College of Physicians was rebuilt on a site in Warwick
Lane, which, until the erection there of the palatial
residence of Guy of Warwick, the King maker,
was called Eldenesse Lane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Christopher Wren was the architect of the new
College, and its burnished dome gave Garth the opportunity
of displaying his powers of satire <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Witness a dome, majestic to the sight,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And sumptuous arches bear its oval height;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A golden globe, placed high, with artful skill,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Seems to the distant sight—a gilded pill.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Amongst the remarkable men of Harvey’s time were
Shakespeare, Bacon, Van Helmont, and Sydenham, all
of whom had personal intercourse with him; of these
we shall first notice Thomas Sydenham, who was born
in 1624. Boerhaave called him the second Hippocrates
on account of his close observation of the natural phenomena
of disease, but he is too well known to us to
require any detailed description either of his method, or
of his general knowledge. The story of his reply to
Dr. Blackmore, when asked by him what books he
should read, that “Don Quixote was a very good book”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>has been erroneously supposed to express his contempt
for learning, but the joke was a personal one. Blackmore
was a poet, and Sydenham saw that the man who
consulted him did not possess the stuff of which doctors
are made, he therefore referred him to the most lively
piece of writing then in existence, as furnishing fitter
pabulum for a poet, than the dry discussions of medical
subjects could afford. To describe the character of
Sydenham, it would be necessary to call to our aid the
highest forms of panegyric; a good and honourable
man, living in harmony with his brethren, and as far
as the troubled state of the country would allow, in
peace with all men. He lived to see the revolution
of 1688 accomplished, and his aspirations as a patriot
being thus gratified, he died in the following year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Contemporary with Sydenham, we find the celebrated
Sir Wm. Petty, the founder of the Lansdowne family.
He was the eldest son of Anthony Petty, who, Aubrey
the Antiquary tells us, was a clothier in Romsey. In
his early days he showed great liking for all mechanical
operations, and at twelve years of age had acquired
considerable skill in <a id='corr68.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='original: carpentery'>carpentry</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_68.23'>carpentry</a></span> and smiths’ work. Educated
at the free school of his native place, at the age
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>of fifteen he began his remarkable career as a self-helping
man; from his own account, we learn that he
went over to Caen, in Normandy, with a little stock of
merchandise, and had such good success that out of the
profits he educated himself in the French tongue, and
perfected his knowledge of classics and mathematics.
In his twentieth year he had saved about three-score
pounds, and acquired as much progress in mathematics
as any of his age: to his love of learning was joined the
desire to acquire wealth; he was at all times <i>practical</i>,
and seems to have held pecuniary advantage to be the
most comprehensive form of the practical. He tells us
that when the civil wars between the King and Parliament
grew hot “I had <i>sixty pounds</i> in money and went
into the Netherlands and France for three years, and
vigorously pursued my studies, especially that of medicine
at Utrecht, Leyden, Amsterdam, and Paris. I
returned to Romsey with about <i>ten pounds more</i> than I
had carried out of England.” In Paris, Petty made
the acquaintance of Hobbes, who retired early from the
civil wars. Hobbes soon discovered the capacity of
his young friend, and read with him the Anatomy of
Vesalius. He entered at Brazennose College, Oxford,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>in April, 1648, and took his degree there as Doctor of
Physic, in March, 1649. The date of his admission to
the College of Physicians is 25 June, 1650. He had
been previously deputy to Doctor Thomas Clayton,
Professor of Anatomy at Oxford, who laboured under
the singular disqualification of having an insurmountable
aversion to the sight of a mangled corpse. On
the resignation of Clayton in 1651, Petty became
Anatomical Professor, and about the same time he
succeeded Dr. Knight in the Professorship of Music
in Gresham College. About the year 1645, the Royal
Society was formed, and Petty was one of the earliest
members of the Oxford branch.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1652 he was appointed Physician to the Army in
Ireland, which post he retained for seven years, at a
salary of twenty shillings a day, while his practice
produced him £400 a year more. His first great step
to wealth, however, arose from his dealings with the forfeited
lands in Ireland, and in a few years he managed
his financial affairs so skilfully that he acquired a
rental of £18,000 a year; part of this he was dispossessed
of at the Restoration, as being unfairly obtained.
He, however, had still a large fortune at his command,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and bought the Earl of Arundel’s house and gardens
in Lothbury, and erected thereupon the buildings
forming Tokenhouse Yard, which was partly destroyed
by the great fire. Petty had the tact to make his
peace with the new government, and became a favourite
with Charles II., who knighted him, and
bestowed on him the place of Surveyor General for
Ireland; and it is said, by Aubrey, that he was created
Earl of Kelmore, though he never assumed the title.
When the College of Physicians obtained its new
Charter his name was published in the list of Fellows,
although he had then resigned practice. The universality
of his genius is clearly shewn by the list of his
published works. He was a man of a genial character
and handsome <span class="nowrap">person:—</span>“If he has a mind to it,” says
Aubrey, “he will preach extempore, either as a Presbyterian,
Independent, or as a Capucin friar, or Jesuit.”
As a proof of his humour, when he was challenged to
fight by Sir H. Sankey, he told his opponent, that as
his short sight would not allow of the usual mode of
warfare, he would meet him, if he was so minded, in
a dark cellar, each to have a carpenter’s axe for his
weapon: this the knight declined. He died in 1687
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of a gangrene of the foot, and was buried at Romsey,
by the side of his father and mother: there lie his
remains, covered with a flat stone, on which an illiterate
workman has cut these <span class="nowrap">words:—</span>“<i>Here layes
Sir William Pety.</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>The part played by the Good-Wives and Ladies
Bountiful in this age deserves a passing notice, and
we will make one or two quotations from books especially
devoted to their use. Thus: “To make Oil of
<span class="nowrap">Swallows:—</span>Take lavender cotton, spikenut grass,
ribwort, and twenty other simples, of each a handful,
sage of virtue, camomiles and red roses, of each two
handsful, <i>twenty live</i> swallows; beat all together in a
mortar, add a quart of neatsfoot oyl or May-butter,
and mix. This oyl is exceeding sovereign for any
broken bones, bones out of joint, or any grief of the
sinews.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Usnea Humana</span></i>’<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> described as a moss two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>lines long, grown on the skulls of malefactors who
have been a long time exposed to the air. This little
plant is found chiefly in England and Ireland, where
the bodies of men are left hanging in chains for
many years after their execution. It is of a volatile
astringent nature, good for bleeding of the nose, and
of use internally for epilepsy.” The writer adds, “I
have seen in the apothecaries’ shops in London these
skulls exposed with the Usnea upon them.” Then
again we have a whole tribe of “holy remedies” and
cabalistic charms, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hiera Picra and Solomon’s seal are used to this day.
The charm for burns is as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span>“In the name
of, &#38;c. There came two angels from the East, one
brought fire, the other water; I command them both:
out fire!! in water!! and so I say <i>Amen</i>.” This is
mumbled by the charmer, and the sufferer is relieved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>without daring to doubt, for if he <i>doubts</i> the charm is
destroyed. Warts and wens are disposed of by a
similar process.</p>

<p class='c008'>So much for the march of intellect; in its progress
very much like the military goose step.</p>

<p class='c008'>A belief in the curative power of the Royal touch
over scrofulous affections continued to be universally
held so late as the time of William III. Shakespeare
gives us an account of it in the tragedy of Macbeth,
which I have thought worth transcribing. In the
4th Act, Scene 3rd, a room in the King, of England’s
<span class="nowrap">palace:—</span></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Macaulay gives us the following graphic account of
the practice of touching for the scrofula, as performed
by that <i>most religious</i> and <i>gracious</i> King Charles the
Second.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This ceremony had come down almost unaltered
from the darkest of the dark ages to the time of
Newton and Locke. The Stuarts frequently dispensed
the healing influences in the Banqueting House. The
days on which this miracle was to be wrought were
fixed at sittings of the Privy Council, and were solemnly
notified by the clergy in all the parish churches of the
realm. When the appointed time came, several divines
in full canonicals stood round the canopy of state. The
surgeon of the royal household introduced the sick.
A passage from the sixteenth chapter of the Gospel of
St. Mark was read. When the words ‘They shall lay
their hands on the sick, and they shall recover’ had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>been pronounced, there was a pause, and one of the sick
was brought up to the King. His Majesty stroked the
ulcers and swellings, and hung round the patient’s neck
a white ribbon, to which was fastened a gold coin. The
other sufferers were then led up in succession; and, as
each was touched, the chaplain repeated the incantation,
‘They shall lay their hands on the sick, and they shall
recover.’ Then came the epistle, prayers, antiphones
and a benediction.... Theologians of eminent
learning, ability, and virtue gave the sanction of their
authority to this mummery; and, what is stranger still,
medical men of high note believed, or affected to
believe, in the balsamic virtues of the royal hand. We
must suppose that every surgeon who attended Charles
the Second was a man of high repute for skill; and
more than one of the surgeons who attended Charles
the Second, has left us a solemn profession of faith in
the King’s miraculous power.... We cannot
wonder that, when men of science gravely repeated
such nonsense, the vulgar should believe it. Still less
can we wonder that wretches tortured by a disease over
which natural remedies had no power should eagerly
drink in tales of preternatural cures: for nothing is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>credulous as misery. The crowds which repaired to the
palace on the days of healing were immense. Charles
the Second, in the course of his reign, touched near a
hundred thousand persons. The number seems to have
increased or diminished as the King’s popularity rose
or fell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In 1682, he performed the rite eight thousand
five hundred times. In 1684, the throng was such that
six or seven of the sick were trampled to death.
James, in one of his progresses, touched eight hundred
persons in the choir of the Cathedral of Chester. The
expense of the ceremony was little less than ten
thousand pounds a year, and would have been much
greater but for the vigilance of the royal surgeons,
whose business it was to examine the applicants, and
to distinguish those who came for the cure from those
who came for the gold.” (<i>History of England, Vol.
III., p. 478.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'>William the Third gave great offence to the nonjurors
by sneering at a practice sanctioned by the highest
ecclesiastical authorities; yielding to importunity, he
once consented to lay his hands on a patient, but his
good sense compelled him to <span class="nowrap">exclaim:—</span>“God give you
better health and more wisdom, my friend.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Shortly after the death of Sydenham came Dr.
Freind, who was born in 1675. Being a man of worth
and learning, he soon acquired a leading position in
his profession, and having devoted himself early in life
to the study of politics, he was returned to Parliament
as member for Launceston, where, having warmly
espoused the cause of the amiable Atterbury, he fell
under the censure of Walpole, who sent him to the
Tower on a charge of treason. This misfortune gave
rise to one of the finest instances of devotion, on the
part of his friend Mead, that has ever been recorded
for the honour of human nature. Walpole was taken
seriously ill, and of course sent for Mead, who at that
time was the most popular physician. The doctor is
reported to have addressed the minister <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span>“You
are very ill, Sir Robert, and I can cure you; but one
condition is indispensable. Dr. Freind has been in
prison some months, and my esteem for him is so
great that I will not prescribe a single thing for you
until he is set at liberty.” Walpole hesitated, but
Mead was resolute, and at length the tyrant gave way.
Freind was released, and Mead when he paid his first
visit of congratulation, took with him a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>sum of money, the produce of fees he had received from
Freind’s patients during his incarceration. Freind was
a voluminous writer, and compiled a history of medicine
in which he attacked some of the opinions of Leclerc,
who had gone more extensively and accurately into the
subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next in order, we must say a few words of Dr. Mead.
Richard Mead was born in 1673, at Stepney. Political
troubles drove his father, who was rector of the parish,
into Holland, where this future ornament of the medical
profession was educated, at Utrecht, under Grœvius.
He continued his studies at Leyden, and travelling into
Italy, took his degree of doctor at Padua. On his
arrival in England, whither his fame had preceded him,
the University of Oxford confirmed his title, and the
College of Physicians received him with applause, as
did the Royal Society (then but recently established.)
He soon became the leading practitioner of the day, and
in course of time Physician to George the Second. For
more than half a century he attended at St. Thomas’s
Hospital, and is said to have suggested to Guy the
foundation of the hospital known by that name. A
more noble, disinterested, and generous man than Mead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>never lived. His emoluments were very large, and his
benevolence and hospitality kept pace with his income.
It is stated that no poor applicant ever left his door
unrelieved.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Heaven did a recompense as largely send.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After a life of 80 years, he died full of honours, leaving
his many literary labors as monuments of his talents
and industry.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reign of Queen Anne has been called the Augustan
age of literature in England, and was in no less degree
looked upon as the great day of medical science.
Amongst the literary men we have to name Swift,
Addison, Warburton, Pope, Steele, Parnell, Rowe,
Gay, and others; and amongst Physicians—Freind,
Mead, Radcliffe, Cheselden, Arbuthnot, Garth, &#38;c. &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Radcliffe next comes under notice; he was a man
cast in a rougher mould than Mead. John Radcliffe
was born at Wakefield, in Yorkshire, in 1650, and
educated at Oxford, where he became a Fellow of Lincoln
College; after a two years residence he resigned
his Fellowship and devoted himself to physic, removed
to London, and settled in Bow-street, Covent Garden.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>He was a man of ready wit, and great conversational
powers, with much pleasantry and frankness. In 1686
he was appointed physician to Princess Anne of Denmark,
and after the revolution was often consulted by
William the Third; the latter on his return from Holland
sent for Radcliffe, and shewing him his ankles
swollen, and his body emaciated, the doctor brusquely
said, “Truly I would not have your Majesty’s two legs
for your three kingdoms.” This sally lost him the
king’s favour, nevertheless he still prospered, and sat
in Parliament for the borough of Buckingham.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the last illness of Queen Anne, Radcliffe was sent
for, but excused his attendance on account of indisposition;
the Queen died the next day, and Radcliffe was
greatly censured, which is said to have hastened his
own death, which took place three months after.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a story told of his quarrel with Sir Godfrey
Kneller, the celebrated painter. They were next door
neighbours, and enjoyed a certain garden in common.
Kneller complained that Radcliffe took no care that the
door leading into this garden should be kept properly
shut, and sent a snappish message to the doctor, that
if he were not more mindful he would shut up the door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and keep the key. Radcliffe’s answer was, “Tell Sir
Godfrey Kneller he may do what he likes with the
door provided he does not paint it.” Kneller retorted
to this sarcasm, “Tell the doctor I will take anything
from him except his physic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I cannot find that Radcliffe ever published any work;
but at his death he left the munificent sum of £40,000
to the University of Oxford for the formation of a public
library of medical and philosophical science, and a
further considerable sum to provide for an annual augmentation
of books and instruments. Garth, in allusion
to this bequest, remarked that for Radcliffe to
found a library was as if an Eunuch should establish
a Seraglio.</p>

<p class='c008'>Samuel Garth was among the celebrities of this time:
the correspondent of Bolingbroke, the friend of Swift
and Addison, and the patron of Pope, he must have
possessed great merit to have reached such a position.
He was born of a good family in Yorkshire: the date
of his birth I have been unable to discover, but he was
admitted a Fellow of the College of Physicians in 1693.
Johnson classes him with the English Poets, and in
his description of him says, “He is always mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>as a man of benevolence, and it is just to suppose that
his desire to help the helpless disposed him with so
much zeal to undertake the founding of a <span class="nowrap">dispensary:—</span>Whether
physicians have, as Temple says, <i>more</i> learning
than the other faculties I will not stay to inquire, but
I believe every man has found in physicians great liberality
and dignity of sentiment, very prompt effusion of
benevolence, and willingness to exert a lucrative art,
where there is no hope of lucre.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Garth was an active and zealous Whig, and consequently
familiarly known to all the great men of that
party; his orthodoxy was questioned, but it was the
fashion of the times to be a free thinker. Pope apostrophises
him in his second <span class="nowrap">pastoral:—</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Accept, O! Garth, the muses early lays,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That add this wreath of ivy to thy bays.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And again, in conjunction with Arbuthnot, in “the
Farewell to London:”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Farewell Arbuthnot’s raillery</div>
      <div class='line in1'>On every learned sot,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And Garth the best good Christian he</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Although he knows it not.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Pope’s favourite physician was Dr. John Arbuthnot,
and never was grateful affection better bestowed. He
was the son of an Episcopal clergyman in Scotland,
born in 1675, and went through a course of academical
studies at Aberdeen, where he also took the degree of
Doctor of Physic. On his arrival in London he supported
himself as a teacher of mathematics, in which
he was a great proficient, and became known to the
world of letters by his examination of Dr. Woodward’s
“Account of the Deluge,” and by an able treatise on the
“Advantages of Mathematical Learning.” The first
book of the memoirs of “Martinus Scriblerus” has also
been attributed to him. An accident introduced him
to Prince George of Denmark, and led the way to his
appointment as Physician to Queen Anne; he retained
the favour of the Court until the death of the
Queen, when, being more than suspected of Jacobite
proclivities, he was compelled to leave his quarters in
St. James’s Palace, and retired to a small house in
Dover Street.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pope dedicated to him the prologue to his satires, and
thus gracefully mentions <span class="nowrap">him:—</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Friend to my life (which did not you prolong,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The world had wanted many an idle song.”)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>The concluding stanzas are so full of tenderness that
I venture to give <span class="nowrap">them:—</span></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! friend, may each domestic bliss be thine,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Be no unpleasing melancholy mine,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Me, let the tender office long engage</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To rock the cradle of reposing age,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With lenient arts extend a mother’s breath,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Make langour smile and smooth the bed of death.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Explore the thought, explain the asking eye,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And keep a while one parent from the sky!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>On cares like these, if length of days attend,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>May Heaven, to bless those days, preserve my friend,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Preserve him social, cheerful, and serene,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And just as rich as when he served a Queen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>About the time of his preferment he made the acquaintance
of the great luminaries of art and learning,
particularly Swift, (the mad parson as he was first
designated) Pope, Gay, Parnell, Atterbury, Congreve,
&#38;c., and greatly assisted, with his ready and witty pen,
the ambitious Bolingbroke.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is greatly to his honour, in the midst of an age
of scoffers, he retained a deep sense of the importance
of personal religion, and seems to have lived in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>affectionate esteem and remembrance of his friends;
Swift said of him, “Oh! if the world had a dozen
Arbuthnots in it, I would burn my travels” (Gulliver’s);
and on another occasion expresses himself
thus, “Arbuthnot has more wit than all we have, and
his humanity is equal to his wit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For some time before his death he suffered from
asthma and dropsy, and bore his affliction with characteristic
fortitude and resignation. He died in 1734,
leaving a son, who was one of Pope’s executors, and
two daughters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next to the illustrious Scotchman whom we have
just dismissed, comes a very worthy native of the
Emerald Isle—Hans Sloane, the son of Alexander
Sloane, the head of a colony of Scotchmen, who, in the
reign of James I. settled in the north of Ireland.
Hans was born at Killileagh, in the year 1660. He
very early showed a liking for Natural History, and on
his arrival in London attended lectures on Anatomy,
Botany, and their kindred sciences, and formed a close
intimacy with Boyle and Ray. After four years study
he visited Paris and Montpellier, in which places he
took his degrees in Medicine. In 1684 he returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>to London and commenced practice, being a Fellow of
the Royal Society and of the College of Physicians.
On the appointment of the Duke of Albemarle to the
government of Jamaica he accompanied that nobleman,
and thus acquired a rich addition to his Museum of
Natural History. George the First created him a
Baronet, and on the death of Sir Isaac Newton, he
became President of the Royal Society—estimable as
a man, and eminent in science, he lived to a great age,
and at his decease, bequeathed his museum to the
nation, conditionally on the sum of £20,000 being paid
to his executors for the benefit of his survivors: this
sum bore no proportion to the value of his collection,
and as it laid the foundation of the British Museum, it
must ever be regarded as a patriotic and generous act.</p>

<p class='c008'>A curious illustration of the observant mind of Sir
H. Sloane is furnished by the fact of his having noticed
that the natives of the West Indian Islands, who eat
much of the green fat of the turtle, perspired a yellow
oil; the explanation being that the true green fat of
the turtle is a green-coloured cellular tissue enclosing a
yellow oil, which passes through the system undigested.
The anatomical data on which this statement is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>advanced have been, at a comparatively recent period,
verified by actual experiments performed by the late
Dr. Pereira, assisted by our much esteemed former
President, Dr. Daldy. It occurred to my mind
that this fact in dietetics might present a lesson of
caution to an audience peculiarly exposed, as citizens
of London, to the temptation of eating a material,
which, however appetising, is incapable of healthy
assimilation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a sketch of such limited pretension we are compelled
to pass over names well deserving a niche in the
temple of <span class="nowrap">Esculapius:—</span>every letter of the alphabet
furnishes its contingent. To many of the men, into
whose labours we have here entered, the civilised world
is indebted for their contributions to general literature,
as well as to the science of medicine; and in our endeavour
to chronicle their importance, we can never
cease to admire the fertility of their talents, and the
extent of their industry in bringing to light so much
useful knowledge out of the scanty materials by which
their enquiries were <span class="nowrap">aided:—</span>Akenside, Bacon, Boyle,
Blackmore, Cheselden, Darwin, Petty, Ray, among
others, may be noted as examples.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>We have now reached the period at which legitimate
medicine was established in this country; and as my
discourse has already exceeded the assigned limits, it
remains only to record our solemn tribute of the affectionate
remembrance we all entertain towards those
members of our society whose faces we shall so sadly
miss in our next sessional meetings. Constituted as
our cherished society is, as a friendly gathering of
kindred spirits, actuated by mutual necessities, meeting
as brothers, knowing no rivalry but the desire to impart,
each to other, the results of our matured experience,
it is with more than ordinary grief that we bow
submissively when Providence sees fit to lessen our
numbers by death.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it is not we alone who have sustained a loss.
The name of Barlow will live for ages to come as the
type of the scientific physician of the nineteenth century.
A man of cultivated intellect, of elegant mind
and blameless life, of calm judgment and exalted
feeling, I look upon his death as nothing less than
a calamity to the whole medical profession.</p>

<p class='c008'>Too soon, alas! after him, we were shocked by the
almost sudden removal of the accomplished and genial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Jeaffreson, endeared to his brethren by those solid endowments
which mark and govern the high minded
practitioner and amiable gentleman—no less than to the
public by those qualities that are inherent in a warm,
kindly, and generous nature. And, what then shall
we say of our dear friend, Henry Blenkarne, so recently
carried to his rest. Who can ever forget his
pure and simple nature, his spotless life, and those
endearing virtues which attached him so closely to
all whose privilege it was to enjoy his friendship—one
of Nature’s gentlemen, delicate and considerate of
the feelings of others, generous to the poor at the sacrifice
of his valuable life, ready at all seasons to give his
time for the promotion of any and every benevolent
scheme in connexion with our calling; we shall long
mourn over the good old man. As I stood by and
saw his remains committed to the ground but the other
day, my mind reverted to the other honoured members
I have mentioned, and I felt that one and all had
realized and fulfilled to the letter the following monition
of <span class="nowrap">Bacon:—</span></p>

<p class='c008'>“I hold every man a debtor to his profession, from
the which as men of course do seek to receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>countenance and profit, so ought they of duty to endeavour
themselves, by way of amends, to be a help and ornament
thereunto.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I now beg permission to draw the curtain. I have
laid before you, with but little skill, some rapid
sketches of our illustrious predecessors. I have shown
how worthily they have fulfilled their mission; and,
having approached the advent of that great man, to
whose memory we dedicate this evening, I make my
bow and retire, first thanking you for the attention you
have accorded to my dull recital. I pause now because
I can add nothing to your knowledge of the character
and labours of John Hunter. His patience under such
difficulties as would have destroyed an ordinary worker,
and his sublime indifference to personal comfort and
advantage when the interest of that science, which he
so well loved was in question—are “familiar in your
ears as household words.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But, whilst we honour him by these periodical meetings,
and by the discussion of subjects the elaboration
of which formed the happiness of his life, it is only
in the great museum, founded by his energy, that
the grandeur of his character can be felt.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>In that hallowed path, in which he delighted to
tread, the mantle of his genius has fallen upon one
who, with a kindred love, aided by the marvellous
instinct of his own original mind, still follows out
the investigations of the great author, adding each
day something to the <a id='corr92.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='original: knowlege'>knowledge</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_92.6'>knowledge</a></span> which went before,
and still turning over some new page of the book of
Nature, wherein the finger of God has written, in
characters hitherto undeciphered, fresh evidences of
His glorious infinity. Under the auspices of our honorary
member, Professor Owen, we gaze and admire.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The library destroyed by the Caliph Omar, was situated in the
temple of Serapis, and consisted of 300,000 volumes; in addition
to which there existed in the Bruchion quarter of the city of
Alexandria, a second collection of 400,000 books, which was accidentally
lost by fire during the war with Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexandria (founded 332 B.C.) stood in an intermediate position
between the east and west, and united the commerce of Europe,
Aralia, and India; here came first into collision the Greek and
Oriental mind; here the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament
was written; and the collections formed by the ancient
kings of Egypt were rapidly enriched and enlarged by the interchange
of ideas with the Greek philosophers.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The contagiousness of Leprosy was held in universal belief up
to the seventeenth century, when certain writers on the subject
began to question the validity of a doctrine which had been handed
down to them through successive ages, by all the early observers
of the Jewish, Egyptian, Arabian, Grecian, and Hindoo countries,
and the view then advanced has been confirmed by the report of
the Committee recently appointed by the College of Physicians,
who state <span class="nowrap">that:—</span>“The all but unanimous conviction of the most
experienced observers in different parts of the world, is quite
opposed to the belief that leprosy is <i>contagious</i> or <i>communicable</i>
by <i>proximity</i> or <i>contact</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand we have to consider the testimony afforded
us by the shrewd and intelligent teachers of ancient times. Thus,
Aretæus believed it to be as contagious as the <i>plague</i>, and like <i>it</i>
communicable by respiration; and <i>Œtius</i>, following <i>Archigenes</i>,
thought that “the air became contaminated through the effluvia
of the sores.” <i>Avicenna</i> believed leprosy to be contagious in the
<i>general</i> sense of that term; <i>Avenzoar</i> by contact; <i>Haly Abbas</i> and
<i>Alsaharavius</i> through the respiration; and <i>Rogerius</i> “<i>per coitum</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>[These interesting facts are taken from an able article in the
Lancet, February 9, 1867.]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. <i>Pliny</i> tells us that the priests of <i>Cybele</i>, the mother of the
gods had sharp stones with which they cut themselves in their
extasies. <i>Catullus</i> says, that <i>Atys</i> emasculated himself with such
an instrument.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Rabbinical law stands thus: “we may circumcise with anything,
even with a flint, with crystal (glass) or with anything that
cuts, <i>except with the sharp edge of a reed</i>, because the <i>enchanters</i>
make use of that, or it may bring on a disease.” Again we have
the evidence of <i>Leutholf</i> that the Æthopians used <i>stone knives</i> for
circumcision in his time, 1581. Speaking of the <i><a id='corrfn3.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='original: alnajah'>Alnajah</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_fn3.11'>Alnajah</a></span></i>, an
Æthopian race, he <span class="nowrap">says:—</span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alnajah gens Æthiopum cultris
lapideis circumcisionem peragit.</span>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. E. B. Tylor in his “Researches into the Early History of
Mankind,” has suggested as the probable reason why stone was
used as a cutting instrument, that it was less likely to cause
inflammation than either bronze or iron. And <i>Pliny</i> states that
the mutilation of the priests of <i>Cybele</i> was done with a sherd of
Samian ware to avoid the same danger.</p>

to Celsus, (book i.) what concerned <i>diet</i> was invented long after
by Hippocrates. The accidents of life make the search after
remedies too indispensable a duty to be neglected at any time;
accordingly, he tells us, that the Egyptians, who had many
medicinal plants in their country, were all Physicians, and
perhaps he might have learnt his own skill from his acquaintance
with that nation.</p>

in the healing of wounds, and this might make him breed his
princes, Achilles, Patroclus, Podalirius and Machaon, to the
science; what Homer thus attributes to others he himself knew,
and he has given us reason to believe, not slightly, for if we
consider his insight into the structure of the human body, it is
so nice, that he has been judged by some to have wounded his
heroes with too much science; or, if we observe his cure of
wounds, which are the accidents proper to an epic poem, we
find him directing the chirurgical operations, sometimes infusing
lenitives, at other times bitter powders, when the effusion of
blood required astringent qualities.”—<i>Pope’s Essay on the Character

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
